### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Speech word level vs. Historical ranking?
+ This project is conducted by [Yi (Vic) Jiang]

+ Project summary: Every time a new president was elected, the first speech -- inaugural speech would play an important role in capture people's heart and gather faith from them. However, does a good speech means a good president? And what's the definition of good? In this program I will try to analyze the relationship between speech word level and presidents' historical ranking.
